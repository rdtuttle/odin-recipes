    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade banana pudding recipe from scratch was handed down from my grandmother. My whole family loves it and we all grew up on it. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>⅔ cup white sugar</ul>
    <ul>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</ul>
    <ul>¼ teaspoon salt</ul>
    <ul>3 eggs, beaten</ul>
    <ul>2 cups milk</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons butter, softened</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
    <ul>2 bananas, peeled and sliced</ul>
    <ul>½ (12 ounce) package vanilla wafer cookies</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>1. Combine sugar, flour, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Add eggs and stir well. Stir in milk, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly.</ol>
    <ol>2. When the mixture has thickened enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, remove from heat and continue to stir, cooling slightly. Stir in butter and vanilla until smooth.</ol>
    <ol>3. Layer pudding with bananas and vanilla wafers in a serving dish. Chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.</ol>
