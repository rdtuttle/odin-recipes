    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that is made with alternating layers of wide, flat pasta noodles, tomato sauce, meat (such as ground beef or Italian sausage), and a creamy cheese filling (typically made with ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese). The dish is often baked in the oven until the top layer is golden brown and crispy.
